It does have weaknesses like lack of sustain and nothing to really fall back on if Smash doesn't hit (at least till the next cooldown). Also it's one of those specs that is very gear dependent, meaning with bad gear, it is very very bad because of the weaknesses above. But it's also a spec that gets exponentially better once you have awesome gear because everything is focused down to a single bursty AOE attack that automatically crits and is kinetic damage so Knights can completely ignore accuracy and crit rating and stack main stat, power, and surge (which explains the 6.7k+ hits). So again, didn't think it was broken, but did think it was a bit too strong pre 1.4. And now it's getting buffed. Sadface.jpg\n",
